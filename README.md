## About

This is a project designed to locate nearby rock climbing routes and to display useful information regarding information, type of climb, and difficulty of climb. This webapp relies on the MountainProject API for route information, and the DarkSky API for details about the weather. Routes can be filtered by the type of climbing available. At the moment, the default number of climbs to initially load in is 50. 

The purpose of uploading this code is to highlight the structure and layout of this webapp. Because the full code requires the usage of private API keys, this version has been modified and the data shown is hardcoded. The actual web app is much more dynamic and supports any location, provided that there are rock climbing routes nearby.

## To Be Added

Several features that I plan on adding to this project:
1. An embedded map containing markers of the listed routes, with the ability to drag and search for more routes
2. The ability to search for specific locations
3. Directions / Distance information on accessing nearby crags
